Ian Hunter, the last of the founding family, visited the bourbon distilleries in Kentucky around 70 years ago to learn their ageing techniques. Up to this point, all the casks were from Europe, which resulted in a much sweeter Laphroaig. Hunter had a selection of ex-bourbon casks shipped to Scotland so that he could test these casks on his whisky. This is the beginning of Laphroaig as we know it.

Here, whiskies from different cask maturations (Oloroso sherry, Bourbon, new oak casks) are married in a unique solera cask. There, the flavours from the individual casks react with each other. It is therefore not a pure sherry cask whisky, as it is not stored using the solera method, but has only been married for a limited time. This process gives it the same fascinating flavours over the years. In 2019, Glenfiddich relaunched its core range with a new bottle design. The title 'Our Solera Fifteen' emphasises the special nature of the solera process used at the distillery. The origin has been stylistically transferred to the bottle design: the V-engraving on the bottle symbolises the 'Valley of the Deer' (Glenfiddich in Gaelic), the distillery's place of origin. The bottles are also triangular (triangular) in shape because Single Malt is made from three core ingredients (water, yeast and grain) and because the bottles feel like you are shaking hands with a good friend.

Talisker is now marking the occasion with the launch of the Talisker x Parley: Wilder Seas bottling, the distillery's first ever 100% recycled/clean energy glass bottle and also the first ever bottling to be finished in XO Cognac casks. To ensure that the protection of the world's oceans can continue to be pursued, researched and expanded, £3.00 per bottle sold is passed on directly to the non-profit organisation Parley. This creates a win/win/win situation for every buyer: after purchasing, you own one of the limited edition bottles, can enjoy it as you wish and also do something for the environment.

And so smoky distillate was distilled at Balvenie for just one week. The Highland peat used has a higher proportion of non-phenolic content. This results in an earthy, smoky character without the salty, maritime flavours that can be found in Islay whiskies, for example.

These were chosen to give the malt additional depth of flavour and complexity. The slow distillation is carried out on two copper pot stills with exceptionally long lyne arms, which prevents the mash from burning during distillation. The limited first bottling is matured in ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. The Islay whisky is then bottled after 5 years at 50% vol, non-chill-filtered and without colour. With Ardnahoe, the Laing family fulfils a long-standing wish for its own distillery and markets the first release with this bottling.

For the high-vanillin casks, new oak casks were specially toasted for the first time in order to concentrate the fine vanilla flavour on the oak surface so that it is passed on to the Single Malt in the best possible way. The creation process for these special casks was specially designed by the Glenmorangie creation team and Dr Bill Lumsden. This involved experimenting with different toasted woods before selecting the casks accordingly. The end result is a successful homage to the ice cream parlours of this world.

High gravity mashing extracts more sugar and ensures even more intense flavours. After maturing in former bourbon barrels, the result is a Single Malt with complex flavours. A bold creation for all those who love Ardbeg - only even more intense and with tropical-fruity notes. The special bottling was created for the Fèis Ìsle Festival 2025 and is initially only available to members of the Ardbeg Committee.

In addition to bourbon casks, refill and rejuvenated oak casks were also used. Reactivation means that the barrels are refurbished to extend their useful life. This involves scraping the inside to expose fresh wood, which then comes into contact with the whisky again. The STR method (Shave, Toast, Re-Char) was created by Dr Jim Swan. In this process, the staves of the barrels are scraped down to the reddish shimmering surface on the inside and then flamed out, which leads to the caramelisation of the wood. This promotes mild flavours such as caramel, toffee and vanilla in the whisky matured in these casks.

A high malt content (70%) combined with a high proportion of former sherry casks makes the blend a fruity and pleasantly fine-spicy flavour experience.

From this, the technology company created an AI model that suggested new recipe ideas. AI:02 is the second of the five selected recipes in the series. The idea of distilling a Swedish whisky was born during a ski trip with eight friends in 1998, when everyone brought a bottle of whisky and the conversation centred on whisky. This gave rise to the Mackmyra Bruk distillery, which produces its whisky using only local ingredients and without colouring. The founders have also immortalised themselves in the bottle design: There is a dent - 'a fingerprint, so to speak' - at the bottom of the bottle for each of the eight friends.

Here, whiskies from different cask maturations (Oloroso sherry, Bourbon, new oak casks) are married in a unique solera cask. There, the flavours from the individual casks react with each other. It is therefore not a pure sherry cask whisky, as it is not stored using the solera method, but has only been married for a limited time. This process gives it the same fascinating flavours over the years. In 2019, Glenfiddich relaunched its core range with a new bottle design. The title 'Our Solera Fifteen' emphasises the special nature of the solera process used at the distillery. The origin has been stylistically transferred to the bottle design: the V-engraving on the bottle symbolises the 'Valley of the Deer' (Glenfiddich in Gaelic), the distillery's place of origin. Included in the scope of delivery are two glasses with the Glenfiddich stag on the bottom. So you can also enjoy the Single Malt in company. The popular single malt also comes in a limited edition, new and colourful design by Raku Inoue!

The Islay single malts under the brand are produced by the well-known Morrison whisky family. The Terra (= earth) bottling is characterised by peat smoke, which derives its properties from the soil of Islay. The approach for this limited edition, created from just 10 sherry butts, is to emphasise the unique harmony between sherry and peat and at the same time present a new style of Islay malt. Matured for 7 years in sherry casks, the single malt has been given distinctive flavours that set it apart from most other sherry cask bottlings from Islay. The 75% first fill and 25% refill sherry casks come from Bodegas Jose y Miguel Martin in Jerez, Andalusia, Spain. After vatting, the whisky is left to rest for 3 months to allow the flavours to mingle. The 30-40ppm phenol content combines with the fruity, sweet and spicy notes of sherry.

The Single Malt comes from the north-west of Islay and stands out from most of its neighbours as it is not smoky. Bunnahabhain uses two steam-heated pot stills, which are considered to be the largest in Scotland. Their pear-shaped, rounded construction makes for a particularly flavoursome distillate, which acquires fruity facets as it matures. The term ""100 proof"" comes from the Anglo-Saxon world and indicates the alcohol strength of a drink. In the USA, 100 proof corresponds to an alcohol content of 50 % vol. (1 proof = 0.5 % alcohol). The term goes back to a historical method of determining the alcohol content: at that time, a mixture of alcohol and gunpowder was set alight - if it burned with a clean flame, the alcohol was considered ""proof"", i.e. proven. Today, this term is mainly used for strong whiskies with a high alcohol content.

The 100 Proof Edition focuses on special Single Malts and Single Grain Whiskies that have been bottled at a minimum of 57.1% vol. without chill-filtering and without the addition of colour. The term proof is a very old unit of measurement for the alcohol content of a drink, especially whisky, which indicates the minimum alcohol content above which gunpowder soaked in the liquid can be ignited.

The bottling honours the cultural heritage and longstanding work of the Mitchell family, who began filling empty wine and fortified wine casks at the local Jameson distillery in the 18th century. The filled barrels were then stored in the underground cellars and marked with coloured dots. The coloured dots were there to document the age of the whisky resting in them. This bottling also pays homage to the Secondo Marco winery, from which the wine casks used for the finish originate. Marco Speri founded the company, which has been synonymous with first-class wine creations from the Valpolicella region for seven generations. The Gold Spot was therefore matured in ex-bourbon and ex-sherry barrels before being aged for 16 months in Italian Valpolicella Classica wine barrels.

The Bruichladdich Wrap is the first packaging of its kind in the whisky industry to be made from 100% fully recyclable paper pulp. The new, weight-optimised bottle design also helps to optimise sustainability and reduce the distillery'sCO2 footprint. It is no coincidence that Bruichladdich is one of the few B-Corp certified whisky companies in the world. Strict requirements must be met and adhered to at all times in order to obtain certification, which is monitored at regular intervals by a responsible government commission. The whisky itself first matures in ex-bourbon casks and is then finished in Sauternes and port wine casks. Before it is filled into modern bottles at 50% vol. without being chill-filtered and without the addition of colour, the three types of cask are married together for nine months.

The non-smoky single malt parts of the whisky matured in ex-Tawnyport wine casks and a fresh cask of Bulgarian oak.

Ex-bourbon and ex-rye barrels as well as former brandy barrels round off the heavy metal flavour experience.

It consists of 84% corn and 8% each of rye and barley malt. It is matured in barrels with burnout degrees 2 and 4, whereby the barrels are burnt out under the flame for around 30 seconds for degree 2 and 55 seconds for degree 4. The different layers of charcoal act as a filter and soften the alcoholic sharpness of the distillate and release additional caramel and vanilla notes in the barrel through the caramelisation of the wood sugar. The popular sour mash whisky from the Cascade Hollow Distillery was bottled at 40% vol.

Here, whiskies from different cask maturations (Oloroso sherry, Bourbon, new oak casks) are married in a unique solera cask. There, the flavours from the individual casks react with each other. It is therefore not a pure sherry cask whisky, as it is not stored using the solera method, but has only been married for a limited time. This process gives it the same fascinating flavours over the years. In 2019, Glenfiddich relaunched its core range with a new bottle design. The title 'Our Solera Fifteen' emphasises the special nature of the solera process used at the distillery. The origin has been stylistically transferred to the bottle design: the V engraving on the bottle symbolises the 'Valley of the Deer' (Glenfiddich in Gaelic), the distillery's place of origin. The bottles are also triangular in shape, because Single Malt is made from three core ingredients (water, yeast and grain) and because the bottles feel like you are shaking hands with a good friend.
Now the popular Single Malt is available in a limited, new and colourful design by Raku Inoue!

For this reason, the Welsh-speaking community in Chubut invited Professor Brian Morgan at the end of March 2022. Morgan, one of the founders and first chairman of Penderyn Whiskey, gave a lecture on the Penderyn brand and met the owners of La Alazana Distillery. They had travelled 600 km from the Andes to offer a diverse selection of single malt whiskies for tasting purposes. This meeting developed into a close and friendly business relationship, which in turn led to the Penderyn Patagonia.

Turas Math means ""good journey"" in Gaelic, and this was the inspiration for this first bottling. The Single Malt comes from the distillery on the north-east coast of Islay, where the sea air and gentle climate have their very own influence on the maturation process. Unlike many other Islay whiskies, Bunnahabhain often forgoes strong smoky notes - as is the case with the Turas Math bottling. The focus is on the casks used. Spanish sherry casks, American refill casks and Italian red wine casks were used and were carefully selected in order to charge the whisky's maritime origin with various cask influences. The bottling is non-chill-filtered, non-coloured and bottled at 55.9% vol, like many of the distillery's small batch releases. The 15-year-old Single Malt was originally conceived for travel retail.

The silver lines below the cork represent the Taiwanese Central Mountains and the Xueshan Mountains, which surround the Kavalan distillery. The water used for production is filtered through volcanic rock and is therefore particularly rich in minerals. The elegant gift box, which is decorated with the zodiac sign of the dragon and illustrations of the distillery, contains a violet of Kavalan Wine Oak, which has been matured in selected wine barrels. After being used for wine, the barrels were carefully scraped, toasted and burnt out. This considerably increased the full intensity of the fruity notes, which the whisky has clearly absorbed.

The limited edition combines these two highlights from the famous Sonoma County wineries. The wineries matured their red wines in used Woodford Reserve barrels and developed the new genre 'Bourbon Barrel Aged'. Sonoma County wines are characterised by rich vanilla and caramel notes. This fact and the positive reaction of the Woodford Reserve fan community inspired Elizabeth McCall to experiment with different combinations of the three wines and also to refine this Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey in the wine barrels from Sonoma County in which Woodford Reserve was originally stored.

The Sazerac Company, which is behind Ancient Age, is based in Metairie, Louisiana, and produces its Bourbon whiskey at the Buffalo Trace distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Sazerac was founded in New Orleans in 1869, when Thomas H. Handy took over the Sazerac Coffee House - a bar with roots in the 18th century. Today, the company focuses on Bourbon production and owns several distilleries, including Buffalo Trace and Barton Brands. Ancient Age Bourbon first came onto the market in 1936 and has been produced in the USA as genuine Kentucky Straight Bourbon since the Second World War. During Prohibition, the whiskey was marketed for medicinal purposes.

The raw spirit of this bottling, which was distilled back in 2008, was refined in Palo Cortado sherry butts for three whole years after its initial maturation and bottled without chill-filtering or colouring. The series was created as a result of the current resurgence in tapas culture, which is closely associated with sherry, and as a tribute to dessert wine. Almost no tapas meal ends without a glass of good sherry.
Paolo Cortado is a rather rare variety of sherry that is created by chance when flor yeast forms on the sherry that is to develop into Amontillado. The sherry comes into contact with flor yeast (biological maturation) and oxygen (oxidative maturation). In earlier times, however, something went wrong during contact with the flor yeast, making the style unpredictable and impossible to plan.

The new design of the Bowmore 12 year old is kept in simple black colours. The lines incorporated are intended to express the history of the spirit in the clearest and most authentic way. The predominant use of the colour black, which has been a trademark for decades, is also a tribute to one of the iconic whiskies - the Black Bowmore distilled in 1964. In addition, the lines could symbolise the nature of the peat soil that gives Bowmore bottlings their pleasantly smoky taste.

Rare casks from distilleries that have already closed, sought-after Single Malts from distilleries that no longer release casks or whiskies from distilleries that no longer produce under their own name are tracked down, bottled and brought to market by Signatory Vintage. The 100 Proof Edition focuses on special Single Malts and Single Grain Whiskies that have been bottled at a minimum of 57.1% vol. without chill-filtering and without the addition of colour. The term proof is a very old unit of measurement for the alcohol content of a drink, especially whisky, which indicates the minimum alcohol content above which gunpowder soaked in the liquid can be ignited. This method was used in the heyday of seafaring so that the barrels in the belly of the ship could withstand the harsh weather conditions at sea.

In this series, exclusive whiskies with an alcohol content of at least 57.1% vol. are bottled. The term proof is an ancient unit of measurement for the alcohol content of a drink, particularly whisky, which indicates the minimum alcohol content above which gunpowder soaked in the liquid can be ignited. This method was used in the heyday of seafaring so that the barrels in the belly of the ship could withstand the harsh weather conditions at sea.

The Islay Single Malt Whiskies under the brand are produced by the well-known Morrison whisky family. The Virgin Oak release is a successful composition of former Bourbon and heavily charred Virgin Oak casks from the Kelvin Cooperage in Kentucky. The Virgin Oak casks have been treated with a grade 4 burnout (alligator char), which allows the whisky to interact intensively with the American oak, giving it a full-bodied yet mild flavour. The intensity of the char is counted from one to four, with four being the highest. The number four is often referred to as alligator charcoal because the surface of the burnt wood cracks and looks like the rough skin of an alligator. After maturation is complete, the Islay whisky was married in virgin oak casks for three months before bottling, giving it creamy-sweet facets and a subtle oak spice with vanilla. The otherwise dominant peat smoke therefore plays a rather subordinate role, but is present. Virgin oak is becoming increasingly important in the whisky industry, but this bottling is the first virgin oak matured whisky from Mac-Talla.

Waterford's main focus is on capturing the terroir and biodynamics, which encompasses the natural factors of land, cultivation, barley type, climate and season. The barley for Fenniscourt Peated 1.1 comes from farmer Ger Byrne's Fenniscourt Farm. With the smoky bottling, the distillery returns to the origins of Irish whiskey production. In order to lose as little of the 'terroir' as possible, Waterford whiskey is only distilled twice, unlike other Irish whiskeys. Maturation takes place in four different types of casks and Waterford is the first distillery to use Irish peat from Ballyteague in County Kildare since the 1850s.

In this case, these contained a so-called ""teaspooned"" Single Malt Whisky - a unique process in which a minimal amount of another malt is added. As a result, this Burnside was classified as a Blended Malt. The bottling matured for an impressive 18 years in a first fill sherry hogshead and combines the long maturation period with the intense influence of the sherry cask. The whisky was bottled at 49.5% to bring out the full flavour. The 18-year-old Burnside is a real rarity, as it is hard to find on the market.

Under the direction of Dr Bill Lumsden, the ex-bourbon casks receive a special ""high mocha"" treatment: the cask bases are deeply notched and burnt out to maximise the wood surface. This unique process enhances the traditional Ardbeg notes, softens salty nuances and intensifies the hidden chocolate sweetness and mocha notes. The result is a multi-layered dram that harmoniously combines SWEET, SMOKED, HERBAL and SHARPNESS in a completely new way, giving Ardbeg's character a new direction.

Glen Ord is known for its The Singleton bottlings, which impress connoisseurs and connoisseurs with their malty and pleasantly sweet flavour facets. The series focuses on special Single Malts and Single Grain Whiskies, bottled at a minimum of 57.1% vol. without chill-filtering and without the addition of colour. The term proof is a very old unit of measurement for the alcohol content of a drink, especially whisky, which indicates the minimum alcohol content above which gunpowder soaked in the liquid can be ignited. This method was used in the heyday of seafaring so that the barrels in the belly of the ship could withstand the harsh weather conditions at sea.

The term proof is a very old unit of measurement for the alcohol content of a drink, especially whisky, which indicates the minimum alcohol content above which gunpowder soaked in the liquid can be ignited. This method was used in the heyday of seafaring to ensure that the casks in the belly of the ship could withstand the harsh weather conditions at sea. Signatory Vintage has been operating since 1988 and is known for its high-quality Single Malt Whiskies, which founder Andrew Symington and his team track down in various distilleries. Rare casks from distilleries that have already closed, sought-after Single Malts from distilleries that no longer release casks or whiskies from distilleries that no longer produce under their own name are tracked down, bottled and brought to market by Signatory Vintage.

The US state of Maryland was once the market leader for rye whiskey, with at least 44 distilleries producing there in 1910, 21 of them in Baltimore alone. During the First World War, most of the distilleries switched their production to ethanol, after which Kentucky became the leading producer of rye. The Sagamore distillery was founded in Baltimore in 2015 to bring rye whiskey back to Maryland and is committed to production from field to bottle (From Grain to Glass).

The illustrations by artist Sir Quentin Blake show a different character from Shakespeare's tragedy on each bottle. Sir Quentin Blake is considered Europe's most famous illustrator. Born in 1932, the artist was ennobled by the Queen in 2015 and has already received numerous awards for his works, which are very rarely available to admire or even buy in commercial form.

Distilled in 2017, Filey Bay Orange Wine Barrique was matured in barrique barrels that had previously been filled with Vino Naranja del Conado de Huelva, an intense orange liqueur wine. The production process is similar to that of other liqueur wines, but with one major difference: the grape must used to enrich the base wine was flavoured with orange peel before ageing. The cask absorbed the characteristics of the orange liqueur wine and passed them on to the Filey Bay Single Malt with fruity, spicy orange notes. The maturation process, which lasted over 7 years, initially took place for 3 years and 3 months in former bourbon casks to soften the raw whisky. For a further 3 years and 10 months, the English whisky was transferred to orange wine casks and refined.

It owes this to the long, cool fermentation with brewer's and distillery yeast, the gentle distillation and the 4-year storage in selected amontillado casks. Maturation in the rich barrels makes the Single Malt appear many times older, as it has become charged with the flavours of the amontillado sherry. The Zuidam distillery was founded in 1975 by Fred van Zuidam. As the malted barley for this whisky is milled with windmills, as was customary in the past, the Single Malt was christened ""Millstone"". It is double distilled in copper Pot Still stills and bottled without chill filtration or the addition of colouring agents.

For the distillate from the K pot still, the distillation machine was moved from a historic distillery to the Shizuoka Distillery site high in the mountains of Shizuoka. The distillation temperature requires meticulous adjustment of the mechanism, as it is heated with steam. The long, thin Lyne arm of the pot produces a smooth and unmixed sake with a wonderfully light and fruity flavour. The Pot Still W is fuelled with wood and distils over a strong, open flame that reaches temperatures of up to 800 degrees Celsius.

The Single Malt is the last bottling from the Amarone Cask Trilogy and, at 11 years old, the oldest bottling in the series. As the casks for the Finnish single malt are stored in former shipping containers, the elements can have an even better effect on the casks, creating a striking complexity. Due to the proximity to shipping and the sea, the label of the bottle was also designed with the god of the sea, Poseidon.

The lines incorporated are intended to express the history of the spirit in the clearest and most authentic way. The predominant use of the colour black, which has been a trademark for decades, is also a tribute to one of the iconic whiskies - Black Bowmore, distilled in 1964. The lines could also symbolise the nature of the peat soil, which gives Bowmore bottlings their pleasantly smoky taste. Bottled at 43%, Bowmore 18 Year Old is pleasantly smoky with delicate fruit and chocolate flavours.

In the 35th Anniversary Edition, the independent bottler presents exclusive, very old single casks from renowned distilleries on Islay, the Orkney Islands, Speyside and the Highlands. The cask-strength bottlings are packaged in high-quality wooden caskets and supplied with a certificate of authenticity signed by Andrew W. Symington, which underlines the exclusivity of these whiskies in addition to their natural colour. The 32-year-old Speyside single malt from the Mortlach distillery was matured in a first fill Oloroso sherry butt.

The character of this whisky reflects the level-headed and noble personality of Lennox from The Thanes series in the Macbeth Collection Act Two. Lennox is an astute counsellor to King Duncan in William Shakespeare's famous play. With its fine structure and long-lasting finish, the Single Malt also represents Lennox's loyalty in liquid form. The Macbeth Collection was created through the collaboration of Scotch designer Lexi Livingstone Burgess, Sir Quentin Blake, whisky expert Dave Broom and the world-renowned independent bottler Elixir Distillers from England. The illustrations by artist Sir Quentin Blake show a different character from Shakespeare's tragedy on each bottle. Sir Quentin Blake is considered Europe's most famous illustrator. Born in 1932, the artist was ennobled by the Queen in 2015 and has already received numerous awards for his works, which are very rarely available to admire or even buy in commercial form. Dave Broom, spirits expert and author, wrote the tasting notes in poetic form. This allows Shakespeare fans as well as connoisseurs and collectors to recognise the common thread of the concept of this coveted series and gain a first impression of the flavour nuances to be expected.
The elegant packaging box with an indentation for the bottle also contains an extract from a monologue by Lennox, the well-informed youngster who has a deep dislike of Macbeth.

The Apex Terroir series from M&H is designed to show how the respective location characterises the whisky where it is stored. The series was inspired by the vision of the legendary whisky visionary Dr Jim Swan, who died in 2017 and described the regions of Israel as a ""playground"" for innovation. The bottlings in the series symbolise the influence of climate on maturation, from fluctuating humidity and temperature conditions to the influence of altitude. Each location characterises the whisky through the cask maturation and gives it a previously unexplored depth with full character. The Negev Desert Whisky is a tribute to the Negev desert, which is known for its dry sand dunes and icy cold nights. The barrels stored there expanded greatly during the day and contracted again sharply at night. These temperature fluctuations, the maturation at 563 metres above sea level and the widely varying humidity of between 35% and 90% resulted in a versatile whisky with chocolatey notes, fruit and nuts.

It had to be complex, affordable and authentic. Malt whiskies from selected distilleries from Bourbon and sherry casks were blended together. The result is a fresh, fruity blended malt that has been given a complex, spicy flavour with a hint of oak on the finish thanks to the addition of sherry cask whisky.
No chill-filtering, no post-colouring and an alcohol strength of 46%, as estimated by experts, make this Blended Malt something extraordinary.

The Diwali festival of lights is primarily a Hindu festival, but is also celebrated by Sikhs, Jains and other religious communities in India. The festival symbolises the victory of light over darkness and good over evil and is celebrated with the lighting of oil lamps and candles, fireworks and the exchange of sweets and gifts. The Single Malt is made from six-row barley, which is kilned over peat fires and carefully distilled in traditional copper Pot Still stills after mashing. The Diwali Single Malt was then matured in one of four hand-picked barrels in India's subtropical climate. Master Blend Surrinder Kumar chose a former Oloroso Ximénez cask for the final maturation of this bottling, which gave the smoky whisky additional notes of dried fruit and slightly sweet caramel tones. Bottled at 58.5% vol. at cask strength without the addition of colour and without chill-filtering.

Bowmore is a typical Islay whisky. It has a beautiful peat smoke note that meets fruity accents and pleasant sea and salt flavours. The new design of the bottle and outer packaging is in a simple black colour. The lines incorporated are intended to express the history of the spirit in the clearest and most authentic way. The predominant use of the colour black, which has been a trademark for decades, is also a tribute to one of the iconic whiskies - Black Bowmore, distilled in 1964. The lines could also symbolise the nature of the peaty soil that gives Bowmore bottlings their pleasantly smoky taste. The new design is classy and represents the high quality of this classic Single Malt.
Discover our Bowmore special offer in our Bowmore brand shop and secure attractive extras when you buy selected bottlings!
